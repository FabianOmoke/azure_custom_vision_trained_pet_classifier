# azure_custom_vision_trained_pet_classifier

Welcome to the **Azure Custom Vision Trained Pet Classifier** project repository! This application allows you to classify images of cats and dogs using a machine learning model trained with the OXFORD PET III DATASET. Please note that the training images have been excluded from this repository due to their large size.

## Running the Image Classification Web App

To run the image classification web app on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Open a Terminal / Command Prompt (CMD).

2. Use the CMD to navigate to the "src" folder. For example:
cd C:\Users\user\path\to\src

3. Use Python from the CMD to create a web server on localhost. This will serve the contents of `index.html` to the web app:

4. Open your web browser and enter the following in the URL bar: `localhost:8000`.

5. Click on the "Browser..." button and upload an image of your favorite cat or dog.

6. Click on the "Predict" button and wait for 1-3 seconds to receive the model's predictions.

## About the Classifier

This image classifier has been developed using Azure Custom Vision and Cognitive Services. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify uploaded images into categories, specifically distinguishing between cats and dogs. The model was trained on the OXFORD PET III DATASET, enabling it to recognize common features and characteristics of these animals.

Azure Custom Vision enables the creation of custom image classifiers without the need for extensive machine learning expertise. Cognitive Services, on the other hand, offers a suite of AI tools and services to empower applications with advanced vision, speech, language, and decision-making capabilities.

By leveraging these Azure services, we have developed an intuitive and efficient pet classifier web app that provides quick predictions based on the uploaded images. This project demonstrates the potential of AI and machine learning in everyday applications, making it easy for users to interact with and understand the underlying technology.
